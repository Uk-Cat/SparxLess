FYI, this project is vibe coded so there maybe bugs and optimisation issues with the code.

As of the Sixteeth of Febuary 2026, this extension work on https://maths.sparx-learning.com which is it's intented Usage.
However, this may subject to change with the changes in sparxs' web structure and possible future anti-scrapping methods.
I may not make any more updates to this extension, so this probably will not keep up with any security measures set in
