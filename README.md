3. Setting Up
Click the SparxLess AI icon.

Click the Settings Icon (top right of the popup).

Enter your Gemini API Key.

Note: You can get a free key at aistudio.google.com.

Select Gemma 3 27B for the best balance of quota and speed.

Click APPLY CHANGES.

4. Usage
Open a Sparx Maths task.

The extension will automatically detect the text.

Click SOLVE PROBLEM.

The AI will calculate the answer, display the reasoning, and attempt to fill the input box automatically.

Future plans:
 - Adding support for more and different AI APIs
 - Adding a global answer database (so you get the answer without using ai, just from people who had that question before)

All credits goes to:
Ant - For compiling and testing the extension
Gemini - For helping to make the UI
Claude  - For implementing the text/image extractor

FYI, this project is vibe coded so there maybe bugs and optimisation issues with the code.

As of the Sixteeth of Febuary 2026, this extension work on https://maths.sparx-learning.com which is it's intented Usage.
However, this may subject to change with the changes in sparxs' web structure and possible future anti-scrapping methods.
I may not make any more updates to this extension, so this probably will not keep up with any security measures set in
place in the future.
